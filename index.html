    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>This is my first website</h2>
    <p> My name is Elin, and I am living my dream life in Spain with my family.
        We left Sweden, sold everything we owned and now we live in a townhouse near the sea. We also travel as much as we can in our self-built van called "Blixten". We take care of 8 cats and 1 dog.I am looking forward to learning this, even though it seems very difficult!
